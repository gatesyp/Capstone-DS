# Capstone-DS

Pairing Graphs Traversals with Template Methods (shortest path)
<br>
Solve a problem using Graph traversals. 
- Shortest path problems

# TODO
1. implement a working graph initilization which must have a clear path from origin to end
  1. maybe do random graph creation, then hardcode a clear path to the end
2. implement a\* algorithm
