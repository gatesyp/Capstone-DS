# Capstone-DS

Pairing Graphs Traversals with Template Methods (shortest path)
<br>
Solve a problem using Graph traversals. 
- Shortest path problems

#To Run
```
g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp -o algo
```

# TODO
1. implement a working graph initilization which must have a clear path from origin to end
  1. maybe do random graph creation, then hardcode a clear path to the end
2. implement Floyd Warshall Algorithm
  1. https://blog.cedric.ws/c-floyd-warshall-shortest-distance-explanation-code
3. test djisktra thoroughly
